# Crisp

A minimalist, responsive, and open-source theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) by [Kathy Qian](http://kathyqian.com).

![Index](https://raw.github.com/kathyqian/crisp-ghost-theme/master/screenshots/index.png)

### Editing Follow Buttons

Crisp uses Font Awesome for icons. See the Font Awesome documentation for the [full list of icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) and [usage tips](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/).

I have placed some common buttons in **follow.hbs**, with more options in the commented out sections. Make sure to replace the `username` in the URLs so the links point to your profiles.

### Features, Changelog, and Technical Notes

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/kathyqian/crisp-ghost-theme/wiki/) for details regarding previous releases.

### Credits

[Kathy Qian](http://kathyqian.com) for its initial Ghost theme.

Many thanks to [@davegandy](http://twitter.com/davegandy) for the [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) icons used throughout the theme.

Social sharing buttons are a modified version of the [Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons](https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb) by [@dbox](http://www.twitter.com/dbox) and [@seagoat](http://www.twitter.com/seagoat). Great job, guys!

Go crazy on the customizations, distribute to your friends, just give me some credit.
