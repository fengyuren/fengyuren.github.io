# Project hub theme for hugo
    

Read more about [project hubs on 24 Ways.](http://24ways.org/2013/project-hubs/)

This is an Hugo theme for online project timelines (also known as "project hubs").

## What is a project hub and why would I use one?
A project hub is a tool for keeping track of the progress of a design project. The hub lives online (either publically available or password protected), so that everyone involved in the team has access to it.
